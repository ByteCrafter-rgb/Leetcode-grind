### Q1: Max Achievable number 
```
Question was trying to trick the user by introducing substraction and addition simultneously.
The only accpetable way to solve this question is through linear algebra, by considering the possiblities and eliminating the neagtive ones because the theme of the problem is greedy in nature.


There were two steps to solve this quesiton:

1- Confusion: I was confused at to why are there so many variables and less number of unknowns?

2- Realisation: Looked at one of the examples and manually solved it. Found out there may be somethign to the requirement of max num
that will cause a polarity in values of the number X. As X has to be maximum and therefore we should try to avoid subtracting a number from it.

Also I re-imagined this addition and substraction as displacemnt. SO in this way two variables can be clubbed together and we can simply
werite and deduce their max and min values in the greedy like situation.
